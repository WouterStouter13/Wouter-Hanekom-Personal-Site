				<h2>Hello.</h2>
				<p class="hello-text">
					I am a Front End Web Developer, constantly learning and pushing to
					become a Full Stack Developer. As much as I love coding, the outdoors
					serve as my escape through activities such as running and hiking. I am
					particularly passionate about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, not only as a
					lifestyle and a force for self-improvement, but I am also an avid
					competitor. <br /><br /><br />
					Having left a career in sales in the wine industry in South Africa, I
					have turned all of my attention to pursue a career in Web Development.
					I started as an absolute beginner in April 2020 and have applied
					myself to learning as much as possible since then, through various
					free and paid online courses. I am looking for an opportunity to be
					employed full-time as a Front-End Web Developer to cement my new
					learned skills and to gain knowledge and experience.
